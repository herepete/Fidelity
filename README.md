# Fidelity

Introduction
============
using beautifulsoup and the Fidelity API to get data back from Fidelity.co.uk

Fidelity has a good site
But there were a few financical bits i wanted to see which aren't easily viewable on 1 page.
1) check current price of funds v a benchmark i have set
2) check which funds have an overlap in their portfolio

This is version 3 , version 1 and 2 were build on a local machine, 
the main difference being version 3 where possible makes use of the Fidelity API (which is a lot nicer than trying to scrape data from a webpage)

the key thing to understand in the API is the ISIN number which is a unique value per fund.

Pre-REquistses
==============
written in python3.6 (anything less than version 3.6 it will error due to string formatting)
beautiful soup and requests have been installed in pip.
Need to be run in Linux as commands such as `clear` are called.

Steps to get running
====================

Edit the stockstocheck.txt as needed ( format: fundname, ISIN number, benchmark cost):

* fundname -can be anything you want, (note if its to long the print formatting will look odd)

* ISIN number - found on the funds page

* Benchmark cost - enter a price here, i entered a price on the last day i invested so if the fund went up or down against the benchmark it was easy for me to see.

Run python script

Example
=======
Help Options
```
# ./version3.py -h

There are 3 tests:
    A) Is the fund beating the 5 year annualized return of the fund
    B) Does the Fund have a 'Above Average' or 'High' 3 and 5 year Morningstar return values
    C) Is it an accumlation fund (i.e not an income fund)
9) Load all funds - (about 3,000)
